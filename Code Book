The run_analysis.R script loads and prepares the date and then executes the 5 steps outline in the course project.

Load raw data set from Coursera R Lab Sandbox:
Dataset uploaded to sandbox in the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset'.

Assign each data to variables:
subjectTest <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
subjectTrain <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
xTest <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
yTest <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
xTrain <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
yTrain <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
xDataSet (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging xTrain and xTest using rbind() function
yDataSet (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging yTrain and yTest using rbind() function
subjectDataSet (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subjectTrain and subjectTest using rbind() function
singleDataSet (10299 rows,  68 columns) is created by merging xDataSet, yDataSet, and subjectDataSet using cbind() function.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
xDataSet_mean_std (10299 rows, 66 columns) is created by subset based on the logical vector to keep only desired columns, i.e. mean() and std().

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the yDataSet replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Acceleration
All GyroJerk in column’s name replaced by AngularAcceleration
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by AngularSpeed
All ^t in column’s name replaced by TimeDomain.
All ^f in column’s name replaced by FrequencyDomain.
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All \\.mean in column’s name replaced by .Mean
All \\.std in column’s name replaced by .StandardDeviation
All Freq\\. in column’s name replaced by Frequency.
All Freq$ in column’s name replaced by Frequency

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Data2 (180 rows, 68 columns) is created by sumarizing singleDataSet taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export into tidydata.txt file.
