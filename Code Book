The run_analysis.R script loads and prepares the date and then executes the 5 steps outline in the course project.

Load raw data set from Coursera R Lab Sandbox:
Dataset uploaded to sandbox in the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset'.

Assign each data to variables:
subjectTest <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
subjectTrain <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
xTest <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
yTest <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
xTrain <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
yTrain <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
xDataSet (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging xTrain and xTest using rbind() function
yDataSet (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging yTrain and yTest using rbind() function
subjectDataSet (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subjectTrain and subjectTest using rbind() function
